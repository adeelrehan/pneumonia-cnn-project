# AI-Based Pneumonia Diagnosis from Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built entirely from scratch. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis while following strict academic guidelines.
## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch for pneumonia detection.
- To preprocess and normalize chest X-ray images for effective learning.
- To train and evaluate the model using clinically relevant metrics.
- To develop a reliable inference mechanism for classifying new chest X-ray images.
- To understand the complete deep learning pipeline including training, evaluation, and inference.
## Domain
Healthcare / Medical Imaging

## SDG Alignment
SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being

## Key Highlights
- CNN model implemented from scratch
- No pretrained models used
- Focus on data preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation
- Clinically relevant evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images collected from a publicly available Kaggle repository. 
The dataset was curated to ensure class balance and data quality.

- Total images used: 800
- Normal class: 400 images
- Pneumonia class: 400 images
- Image format: Grayscale chest X-rays
- Data split: Stratified training, validation, and testing sets

The balanced nature of the dataset helps reduce bias and ensures reliable performance evaluation.


## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Project Status
Initial repository setup completed.
## Results Summary

The CNN model was trained on a balanced dataset of 800 chest X-ray images (400 Normal, 400 Pneumonia).

### Performance Metrics
- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision (Pneumonia): 0.93
- Recall (Pneumonia): 0.98
- F1-score: 0.95

The confusion matrix shows a low number of false negatives, which is critical for medical diagnosis.

### Evaluation
- Training vs validation accuracy and loss curves indicate stable convergence.
- No severe overfitting was observed.
- Evaluation results and plots are available in the `results/` folder.
  
  ## Project Presentation
The final project presentation slides are available in the `presentation/` folder.  
These slides summarize the problem statement, dataset, methodology, model architecture, results, and conclusions.

## Repository Structure
- `Final_ML_Project.ipynb` : Complete end-to-end implementation of the CNN-based pneumonia detection project
- `results/` : Training graphs, confusion matrix, and evaluation outputs
- `report/` : Final project short report
- `presentation/` : Project presentation slides
- `requirements.txt` : List of Python dependencies required to run the project
  ## Reproducibility
All experiments in this project were conducted using consistent preprocessing steps and fixed data splits.
The complete implementation is provided in the notebook along with a list of required dependencies.
This ensures that the results can be reproduced in a similar environment.

## Ethical Considerations
This project is developed strictly for academic and educational purposes.
The model has not been clinically validated and should not be used for real-world medical diagnosis.
Any predictions generated by the system should not replace professional medical judgment.
